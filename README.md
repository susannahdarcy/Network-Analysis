# Network-Analysis
Two Jupyter Notebooks on analysing relationships in Networks . One for co-star relations between actors, and the second the twitter relationship between different tech twitter accounts.

## Notebook 1: Co-star Network Analysis
I constructed and analysed 2 movie datasets. From these datasets I will generate 2 networks which will represent the co-starring relations between actors. For both of my networks I will use a variety of methods to characterise the structure and connectivity of the actors. I will use centrality functions to identify key influential actors. With these influential nodes I will be able to generate a sub ego-centric network, which will also express the connectivity of my networks and the influence of the identified actors. Lastly I will generate a Gephi visualisation which will allow for a better understanding of my network as a whole, from this image I will possibly be able to identify new characteristics of my networks.


## Notebook 2: Technology Twitter List Network Analysis
I analysed the relationships between tech Twitter accounts, by generating networks for their follows, mentions and replies. To characterise these networks I looked into the structure, clustering and reciprocity for the connectivity and relationships within the networks. Degree and Degree distribution showed popular nodes, and the pattern of connections of my network. Lastly, centrality identitied influential nodes.

I also analysed the relationship between the topics by creating a bipartite User-Hashtag network. These can be used to represent which account comment on which themes or topics, and if they share these topics.
